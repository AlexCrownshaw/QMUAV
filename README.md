# QMUAV
The Quad-Motor UAV is a platform designed to allow for learning of Guidance, Navigation and Control of autonomous systems.

## Aims
The Main aim of the QMUAV project is to build an autonomously hovering Quadcopter using ‘off the self-consumer hardware’ and a uniquely design Flight Control System (FCS). The purpose of this being to develop and learn skills in the GNC or Guidance Navigation and Control sector of Aerospace engineering. The project also allows for the demonstration of key engineering skills including the use of technical software (MATLAB – SIMULINK/SOLIDWORKS CAD/Autodesk EAGLE CAD), software engineering in a predominately C++ based language and using Current engineering knowledge to develop a system and make valid design choices.
